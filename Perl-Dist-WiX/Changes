Changes for Perl extension Perl-Dist-WiX

0.11_03 Sat 17 Jan 2009 Curtis Jewell <csjewell@cpan.org>
    - perl, the perl licenses, and the individual 
      modules of the Perl toolchain are now tested
      to generate fragments (now 57 fragments, about 
      800K .wxs source.)
    - Perl::Dist::WiX::Filelist module added to handle
      file list arithmetic and operations.
      
0.11_02 Thu 15 Jan 2009 Curtis Jewell <csjewell@cpan.org>
    - First actual code:
      1: Most routines collect file names
      2: "low-level" routines create strings that 
         "work up the line" and get assembled.
      3: Individual portions of the C toolchain are
         individual wix fragments.
