Changes for Perl extension Perl-Dist-WiX

0.11_05 Mon 19 Jan 2009 Curtis Jewell <csjewell@cpan.org>
    1. Work in progress debugging routines install_win32_extras needs
    2. Documentation of some low-level modules added
    3. Compile test updated with all modules.
    4. Other tests skipped until rewriting done.
    5. Some parameter-checking added.

0.11_04 Sat 17 Jan 2009 Curtis Jewell <csjewell@cpan.org>
    - Verified generation of fragments up to step 4 
      (install_perl_modules) now. (84 fragments, 900K)
    - Removed P::D::W::Toolchain, replaced it with ad-hoc
      _name_to_module method (I want to affect Perl::Dist 
      itself as little as possible)
    - Added more to list of modules that leave .packlist 
      files to check.
    - Removed create_string_fragment method (not being used)

0.11_03 Sat 17 Jan 2009 Curtis Jewell <csjewell@cpan.org>
    - perl, the perl licenses, and the individual 
      modules of the Perl toolchain are now tested
      to generate fragments (now 57 fragments, about 
      800K .wxs source.)
    - Perl::Dist::WiX::Filelist module added to handle
      file list arithmetic and operations.
      
0.11_02 Thu 15 Jan 2009 Curtis Jewell <csjewell@cpan.org>
    - First actual code:
      1: Most routines collect file names
      2: "low-level" routines create strings that 
         "work up the line" and get assembled.
      3: Individual portions of the C toolchain are
         individual wix fragments.
