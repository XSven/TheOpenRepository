 PCE - Perfect Coding Enviroment Version 0.3           GNU/Linux              INSTALLThis document shows how to install PCE on GNU/Linux. In fact, this istested on Debian GNU/Linux but it should work on all other GNU/Linuxand Unix derivates.1. Preconditions 1.1 Installing the required modules2. Configuration3. Installation4. Uninstallation1. PreconditionsFirst, you have to have some perl-modules installed and - naturally -perl itself. We suggest a perl-version > 5.8.6. Here is a list of theneeded perl modules: Wx Wx::STC Wx::DND Wx::XRC Wx::Grid Config::General Hash::Merge File::Copy File::Copy::RecursiveThere are several ways to install this modules: 1.1 Installing the required modulesThe easiest way is to use the package manager of your GNU/Linuxderivate. This may be apt-get on your Debian System or rpm onRed-Hat Linux. Please have a look in your operating system manual.Maybe there are no packages for some of the required modules. Inthis case, you can eather use CPAN to install semi-automatic, oruse the old school configure - make - make install to do the job.If you prefer the CPAN-Way just type for example as root:  # perl -MCPAN -e 'install Wx::STC'This will (maybe) install the module for you. If this doesn't workcontant a perl guru that you know, or try with manual compille:Downlaod the module sources from cpan.org or any other source youprefer. Extract the content (tar -xvzf <package>) and do a  $ ./configure && makeand then as root:  # make installFor a detailled howto just ask google...2. ConfigurationDownload the PCE Source Package from the pce-website and unpack itwith tar -xvzf <archive>. You will see a file calles Makefile.PL.Use this perlscript to generate a Makefile that you can use toinstall PCE.  $ perl Makefile.PLIt will check for the required modules and create the Makefile. Youare able to set diffrent installation directories than /usr/local/.For that, use the showed arguments wenn you run  $ perl Makefile.PL --helpTo change the root-directory for the install type for example:  $ perl Makefile.PL --PREFIX=/usrYou also can use defined directories to define others:  $ perl Makefile.PL --PREFIX=/usr --LIBIDR=<prefix>/lib/<name>Please note, that you probably not be able to install PCE in/usr/local/ as long as you arn't root.3. InstallaionAs soon as you created your Makefile with Makefile.PL you shouldbe able to install PCE with  # make installNote, that you have to be root if you want to install PCE in asystem directory. If you want to install PCE in the userspace, youhave to create another Makefile with Makefile.PL described in (2).4. UninstallationImagine, that you want to uninstall PCE (just hypothetical) justtype:  # make uninstallNote, that you still have to have that Makefile that the insallationwas made with. If you have deleted it, you have to create a new one.Use Makefile.PL the way you would install PCE in the same directoryas it is installed and then run make uninstall.- Wanja Chresta, PCEbarachiel at users.sourceforge.netSorry for the bad english ;)
