Module-Build-Functions version 0.001_002

The best description is an analogy: Module::Build::Functions is to 
Module::Build as Module::Install is to ExtUtils::MakeMaker - a simpler 
syntax to use the base module.

In fact, Module::Build::Functions can replace Module::Install, as it can 
use much of the same syntax, with more by the day.

A syntax like Module::Install that uses Module::Build's terminology is 
also available, and much of it is also usable.
