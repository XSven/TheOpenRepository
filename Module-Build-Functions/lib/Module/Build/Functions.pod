=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module gives a Module::Install-like syntax to Module::Build, using 
modules (other than Module::Build itself) that are in the core in 5.006.

Most commands from Module::Install will be supported, and most parameters to
Module::Build's C<new> routine are supported as commands. This includes 
the share directory implementation that L<Module::Install::Share> and 
L<File::ShareDir> implements.

This means that using this module instead of Module::Install can be as easy 
as replacing the C<use inc::Module::Install> line by 
C<use inc::Module::Build::Functions>, and renaming the resulting file to 
Build.PL.

Unfortunately, Module::Install extensions are not supported, nor is the 
L<Module::Install::DSL> syntax.

You may wish to look at the code for documentation at this point, as not 
all functions are documented yet. B<This will be corrected, I promise.>

=begin readme

=head1 INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

This method of installation will install a current version of Module::Build 
if it is not already installed.
    
Alternatively, to install with Module::Build, you can use the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	Build
	Build test
	Build install

(Use ./Build instead of Build if the current directory is not in your path.)

=head1 INTERFACE 

All functions are exported by default.

Unless specified otherwise, a function is accumulative - it can be 
called more that once to add to a list.

=head2 Functions unique to Module::Build::Functions

=head3 bundler

	perl -MModule::Build::Functions -e bundler

Writes out a copy of the installed version of Module::Build::Functions in 
the inc directory of your distribution.

=head3 functions_self_bundler

	functions_self_bundler;

Calls the L<bundler> function when Module::Build's C<dist> action (actually 
the C<distmeta> action) is called.

This function is incompatible with the use of C<subclass> in the Build.PL. 
If you need to use subclass for other purposes, add the code below to 
your subclass:

	sub ACTION_distmeta {
		my $self = shift;
		require Module::Build::Functions;
		Module::Build::Functions::bundler();
		$self->SUPER::ACTION_distmeta();
	}

=head3 cygwin

	some_code if cygwin;

Returns true if $^O equals cygwin. 

=head3 get_builder

	my $mb_object = get_builder();
	
Creates the L<Module::Build> object (or returns it if already created) 
defined by the functions previously executed in this module.

=head2 Module::Build->new parameters (with synonyms noted)

=head3 Lists of modules

All lists of modules take a module name (with an optional version) or a 
hashref that contains a list of modules and versions.

Versions are specified as L<Module::Build::Authoring|Module::Build::Authoring#Format_of_prerequisites>
specifies them.

If the version parameter is omitted when one module is being added to the 
list, the version is assumed to be 0.

=head4 requires

	requires 'Module::CoreList' => 2.17;
	requires 'Acme::24';
	requires 'Acme' => '!1.11111';

Modules listed using this function are required for using the module(s) 
being installed.

=head4 recommends

	recommends 'Module::CoreList' => 2.17;
	recommends 'Acme::24';
	recommends 'Acme' => '!1.11111';

Modules listed using this function are recommended, but not required,
for using the module(s) being installed.

=head4 configure_requires

	configure_requires 'Module::CoreList' => 2.17;
	configure_requires 'Acme::24';
	configure_requires 'Acme' => '!1.11111';

Modules listed using this function are required for running the 
distribution's C<Build.PL>.

B<Note:> Module::Build does not need to be added to this list, as
Module::Build::Functions will determine the version of Module::Build
required for the functions used.

=head4 build_requires

	build_requires 'Module::CoreList' => 2.17;
	build_requires 'Acme::24';
	build_requires 'Acme' => '!1.11111';

Modules listed using this function are only required for running C<./Build> 
itself, not C<Build.PL>, nor the module(s) being installed.

B<Note:> Module::Build does not need to be added to this list, as
Module::Build::Functions will determine the version of Module::Build
required for the functions used.

=head4 conflicts

	conflicts 'Acme' => '1.11111';
	conflicts 'Perl::Dist' => '<1.14';

Modules listed using this function conflict in some serious way with the 
module being installed, and the Build.PL will not continue if these modules 
are already installed.

=head3 Directories

=head4 c_source

	# Not accumulative - only the last c_source is used. 
	c_source 'src';

This function specifies a directory which contains C source files that the 
rest of the build may depend on. 

See L<Module::Build's documentation on c_source()|Module::Build/c_source> 
for more information.

=head4 include_dirs

=head4 include_dir (Module::Build::Functions synonym)

	include_dir 'include';
	include_dir File::Spec->catdir(qw(include xs));
	
Specifies any additional directories in which to search for C header files. May be given as a string indicating a single directory, or as a list reference indicating multiple directories.

=head4 install_path

	install_path 'lib' '/foo/lib';
	install_path 'man' File::Spec->catdir(File::Spec->rootdir(), 'foo', 'man');

To set specific locations for different types of installable elements, 
call C<install_path> with the type of installable element and the location 
where it should be installed.

I<Recommendation>: Don't use this unless you are either deliberately 
installing outside the default perl library directories, or installing a 
new type, defined by L</install_path>.
	
=head3 Files

=head4 PL_files

=head4 pl_file

=head4 pm_files

=head4 pm_file

=head4 pod_files

=head4 pod_file

=head4 xs_files

=head4 xs_file

Will be documented soon.

=head3 Metadata

Functions in this section are used when generating metadata for C<META.yml> and PPD files. 

=head4 all_from

	all_from 'lib\Module\Build\Functions.pm';

Specifies the file to look for the abstract, the author, the version, the 
license, and the perl version required in.

=head4 dist_abstract
 
=head4 abstract (Module::Install synonym)

	# Not accumulative - only the last dist_abstract or abstract is used. 
	dist_abstract 'Module::Install style syntax for Module::Build';
	abstract 'Module::Install style syntax for Module::Build';

This should be a short description of the distribution. 
	
If either this function, L<abstract_from|#abstract_from>, or 
L<all_from|#all_from> is not given, then Module::Build looks in the POD of 
the module from which it gets the distribution's version. If it finds a POD 
section marked "=head1 NAME", then it looks for the first line matching 
\s+-\s+(.+), and uses the captured text as the abstract.

=head4 abstract_from

	abstract_from 'lib\Module\Build\Functions.pm';

Specifies a file to look for the abstract in.

=head4 dist_author

=head4 author (Module::Install synonym)

	dist_author 'John Doe <jdoe@example.com>';
	author 'Jane Doe <doej@example.com>';
	
This should be something like "John Doe <jdoe@example.com>", or if there are 
multiple authors, this routine can be called multiple times, or an anonymous 
array of strings may be specified. 
	
If either this function, L</author_from>, or L</all_from> is not used, then 
Module::Build looks at the module from which it gets the distribution's 
version. If it finds a POD section marked "=head1 AUTHOR", then it uses the 
contents of this section.

=head4 author_from (Module::Install synonym)

	author_from 'lib\Module\Build\Functions.pm';
	
Specifies a file to look for the author in, using the contents of a 
POD section marked "=head1 AUTHOR" or "=head1 AUTHORS".

If either this function, L</author>, L</dist_author>,or L</all_from> is 
not used, then Module::Build looks at the module from which it gets the 
distribution's version. If it finds a POD section marked "=head1 AUTHOR", 
then it uses the contents of this section.

=head4 dist_name

	dist_name 'Module-Build-Functions';

Specifies the name for this distribution. Most authors won't need to set 
this directly, they can use L<module_name|#module_name> to set C<dist_name> 
to a reasonable default. However, some agglomerative distributions like 
C<libwww-perl> or C<bioperl> have names that don't correspond directly to 
a module name, so C<dist_name> can be set independently.

=head4 dist_version

=head4 version (Module::Install synonym)

	dist_version '0.001_001';

Specifies a version number for the distribution. See 
L<module_name|#module_name> or L<dist_version_from|#dist_version_from> 
for ways to have this set automatically from a C<$VERSION> variable in a 
module. One way or another, a version number needs to be set.

=head4 perl_version

	perl_version '5.006001';

Specifies a minimum version of perl that this distribution requires.

=head4 perl_version_from

	perl_version_from 'lib\Module\Build\Functions.pm';

Specifies a file to look for the minimum perl version in.

=head4 dist_version_from

=head4 version_from (Module::Install synonym)

	dist_version_from 'lib/Module/Build/Functions.pm';

Specifies a file to look for the distribution version in. Most authors 
won't need to set this directly, they can use C<module_name|#module_name> 
to set it to a reasonable default.

=head4 license

	license 'perl';

Specifies the licensing terms of your distribution. Valid licenses are listed in 
L<Module::Build::API>.

=head4 license_from

	license_from 'lib\Module\Build\Functions.pm';

Specifies a file to look for the choice of license in. 

=head4 meta_add

=head4 meta_merge

	meta_add 'provides' { 'Module::Build::Functions' => { file => 'lib\Module\Build\Functions.pm', version => '0.001_010'} };
	meta_merge 'resources' 'bugtracker' 'http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Module-Build-Functions';

meta_add and meta_merge adds their parameters to the C<META.yml> file.

The first parameter is the key to add or merge to, and the second parameter 
is the value of that key (which may be a string, an arrayref, or a hashref.)

The one difference is that meta_add overwrites anything else in that key, 
while meta_merge will merge an arrayref or hashref into the current 
contents of the key. 

Also, meta_merge allows a hashref to be ommitted if it contains only one value.

=head3 Flags

Functions listed here are B<not> accumulative - only the last value a flag has 
been set to will apply.

=head4 create_packlist

	create_packlist 1;
	create_packlist 0; # Not recommended.
	
If this flag is set (and it is set by default), Module::Build will create a .packlist 
file duting the L<install> action.

=head4 create_makefile_pl

	create_makefile_pl 'small';
	create_makefile_pl 'passthrough';
	create_makefile_pl 'traditional';

This function lets you use Module::Build::Compat during the C<distdir> (or 
C<dist>) action to automatically create a C<Makefile.PL> for compatibility 
with ExtUtils::MakeMaker. The parameter's value should be one of the styles 
named in the L<Module::Build::Compat|Module::Build::Compat> documentation.

=head4 create_readme

	create_readme 1;

This function tells Module::Build whether to automatically create a README 
file at the top level of your distribution or not. Currently it will simply 
use Pod::Text (or Pod::Readme if it's installed) on the file indicated by 
dist_version_from and put the result in the README file. This is by no means 
the only recommended style for writing a README, but it seems to be one 
common one used on the CPAN.

If you generate a README in this way, it's probably a good idea to create a 
separate INSTALL file if that information isn't in the generated README.

=head4 create_license

	create_license 1;

This function tells Module::Build whether to automatically create a LICENSE 
file at the top level of your distribution or not. If set to 1, it creates 
a LICENSE file based on the license you give for your META.yml file.

This requires L<Software::License> to be installed.

=head4 dynamic_config

	dynamic_config 1;
	dynamic_config 0;

This function indicates whether the Build.PL file must be executed, or 
whether this module can be built, tested and installed solely from 
consulting its metadata file. The main reason to set this to a true value 
is that your module performs some dynamic configuration as part of its 
build/install process. If the flag is omitted, the META.yml spec says that 
installation tools should treat it as 1 (true), because this is a safer way 
to behave.

Currently Module::Build doesn't actually do anything with this flag - it's up 
to higher-level tools like CPAN.pm to do something useful with it. It can 
potentially bring lots of security, packaging, and convenience improvements.

=head4 installdirs

	# Not accumulative - last one of installdirs or 
	# any aliases to installdirs will be used.
	installdirs 'site';
	installdirs 'core';
	installdirs 'vendor';
	
Determines where files are installed within the normal perl hierarchy as 
determined by Config.pm. Valid values are: core, site, vendor. The 
default is site. See L<Module::Build#INSTALL PATHS>

=head4 recursive_test_files

	recursive_test_files 1;

If this is set to 1, Module::Build will search recursively under C</t> for 
C<*.t> files to use when testing.  Defaults to 0.

=head4 sign

	sign 1;

If this is set to 1, Module::Build will use L<Module::Signature> to create 
a signature file for your distribution during the C<distdir> action.

=head4 use_tap_harness

	use_tap_harness 1;
	use_tap_harness 0;
	
This indicates whether or not to use L<TAP::Harness> for testing rather than L<Test::Harness>. Defaults to false. If set to true, you must add TAP::Harness as a requirement for your module in L</build_requires>. 

This will be set to a true value if tap_harness_args is specified.

=head4 tap_harness_args

	use_tap_harness { verbosity => 1, lib => [ 'lib', 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch' ] };
	
This indicates the options to use when L<TAP::Harness> is used for testing,
and is given as a hash reference.
 
If set, you must add TAP::Harness as a requirement for your module in 
L</build_requires>. 

B<WARNING>: May change to a accumulative function in future versions.

=head3 Other functions

=head4 add_to_cleanup
 
	add_to_cleanup 'Module-Build-Functions-*';
	add_to_cleanup 'Makefile';
	 
Adds a file specification (or an arrayref of file specifications) to the 
list of files to cleanup when the C<clean> action is performed.

=head4 auto_features

	auto_features 'pg_support',    'description' => 'Interface with Postgres databases';
	auto_features 'pg_support',    'requires'    => 'DBD::Pg'                 => '23.3';
	auto_features 'pg_support',    'requires'    => 'DateTime::Format::Pg'    => 0;
	auto_features 'mysql_support', 'description' => 'Interface with MySQL databases';
	auto_features 'mysql_support', 'requires'    => 'DBD::mysql'              => '17.9';
	auto_features 'mysql_support', 'requires'    => 'DateTime::Format::MySQL' => 0;

This parameter supports the setting of features (see L<"Module::Build|feature($name)">) 
automatically based on a set of prerequisites.

B<*WARNING*> The syntax for this may change before 1.000!
	
=head4 autosplit

	autosplit           'lib/Module/Build/Functions.pm';
	
Adds a file (or an arrayref containing a list of files) that need(s) to 
have L<Autosplit::autosplit()|Autosplit#autosplit> ran on them
(because the file in question uses L<AutoLoader>, most likely).

=head4 build_class

	# Not accumulative - only the last build_class is used. 
	build_class 'Module::Build::Subclass';

Sets the name of a subclass of Module::Build that the Build script uses.

This is used if the subclass has requirements that are satisfied by 
L</build_requires>, but are not neccessarily installed when Build.PL 
will be executed.

=head4 extra_compiler_flags

=head4 extra_linker_flags

These parameters can contain strings (which are split on whitespace and accumulate into an array reference in the order added) or array references to pass through to the compiler and linker phases when compiling/linking C code.
For example, to tell the compiler that your code is C++, you might do:

	extra_compiler_flags '-x c++';

To link your XS code against glib you might write something like:

	extra_compiler_flags scalar `glib-config --cflags`;
	extra_linker_flags   scalar `glib-config --libs`;

=head4 get_options

	get_options loud => { store => \$loud };
	get_options dbd => { type => '=s' };
	get_options quantity => { type => '+' };

Adds a command line parameter (or a hashref of command line parameters) that 
the C<Build.PL> or C<Build> script is to process according to the specifications
given (the specification hashrefs are documented in the 
L<Module::Build::API documentation|Module::Build::API#get_options>.)

=head4 create_build_script

=head4 WriteAll (Module::Install synonym)

Creates the I<Build.PL> to be run in future steps, and returns the 
L<Module::Build> object created.

=head3 Supported Module::Install syntax not mentioned above
	
=head4 install_as_core

=head4 install_as_cpan

Aliases for C<installdirs 'core';>. See L<installdirs|#installdirs>.

=head4 install_as_site

Alias for C<installdirs 'site';>. See L<installdirs|#installdirs>.

=head4 install_as_vendor

Alias for C<installdirs 'vendor';>. See L<installdirs|#installdirs>.

=head4 win32

	requires 'Win32' 0.30 if win32;

Returns true if $^O eq 'MSWin32'.

=head4 winlike

	requires 'Win32' 0.28 if winlike;

Returns true if $^O eq 'cygwin' or $^O eq 'MSWin32'.

=head4 release_testing

=head4 automated_testing

Returns true if the appropriate environment variable is set to something 
that is true.

=head4 requires_external_bin

	configure_requires 'ExtUtils::MakeMaker' 6.52 if cygwin;
	requires_external_bin 'svn';

This routine checks that a particular command is available on the host 
system.

The I<Build.PL> file will abort with an I<NA> result if the command is not
available.

The example code shows the one limitation on this routine - because of a
bug in ExtUtils::MakeMaker, this routine does not find some commands on 
Cygwin systems until pre-release versions of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.52.

=head4 requires_external_cc

	requires_external_cc;

This routine checks that there is a compiler and linker on the system, and 
that they actually work, by calling 
L<ExtUtils::CBuilder::have_compiler|ExtUtils::CBuilder/have_compiler>.

The I<Build.PL> file will abort with an I<NA> result if the command is not
available.

=head4 can_run

	configure_requires 'ExtUtils::MakeMaker' 6.52 if cygwin;
	my $has_svn = can_run 'svn';

This routine returns whether a particular command is available on the system.
	
The example code shows the one limitation on this routine - because of a
bug in ExtUtils::MakeMaker, this routine does not find some commands on 
Cygwin systems until pre-release versions of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.52.

=head4 can_cc

	my $has_compiler = can_cc;

This routine returns whether there is a compiler and linker on the system, and 
that they actually work, by calling 
L<ExtUtils::CBuilder::have_compiler|ExtUtils::CBuilder/have_compiler> to 
verify that fact.

=head4 author_context;

	my $is_author = author_context;
	if (author_context) { ... }

Returns true if being run by the author.

This is determined by looking for the C<inc/.author> directory, trying 
to detect a version control system, and looking for the I<MANIFEST.SKIP>
file, in that order.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=for author to fill in:
    List every single error and warning message that the module can
    generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
    explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
    suggested remedies.

=over

=item C<< %s cannot be found >>

There was probably a misspelling in the command name in the Build.PL.

=item C<< %s is not supported yet >>

Module::Build::Functions is not completely implemented yet, so a number of
functions will croak with this error.

Hang on, support will be coming soon!

=item C<< auto_install is deprecated >>

The author has deliberately chosen to drop support for auto_install.
(he happens to be irritated at pre-0.86 Module::Installs that stop 
CPAN upgrades to make him answer an unneeded question.  Of COURSE, I
want prerequisites installed. Why would I not?)

Patches, however, would be welcomed to implement an auto_install that 
is not annoying.

=item C<< bundle is deprecated >>

=item C<< auto_bundle is deprecated >>

=item C<< bundle_deps is deprecated >>

=item C<< auto_bundle_deps is deprecated >>

The author has deliberately chosen to drop support for bundling at 
this point.

Patches, however, would be welcomed.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
  
Module::Build::Functions requires no configuration files or environment 
variables of its own. See L<Module::Build> for its configuration variables
or environment variables.

=for readme continue

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<File::Slurp> and L<Module::Build> are required on the system of an author 
using this module in his Build.PL.

L<Capture::Tiny> version 0.06 or greater is used during testing only.

On the system of the person installing a module using 
Module::Build::Functions, only Module::Build is required.  The version of 
Module::Build that will be required is determined by the functions used.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
