=head1 NAME

Parse::Marpa::Doc::To_Do - Marpa's To Do List

=head1 HIGH PRIORITY

=head2 Terminal Priorities Cannot Be Set in MDL

Priorities cannot be set in MDL for terminals.
Fix this before going beta.

Workaround:
Add extra rules with the terminals you want to prioritize on their right hand side,
and assign 
priorities to the rules.

=head2 Describe ambiguous transitions in Internals doc

Add a graf about ambiguous transitions in the Internals document.

=head2 Rename Evaluator::next method to Evaluator::value

=head1 LOWER PRIORITY

=over 4

=item * Prune structures in Grammar.pm, and Recognizer.pm.
Earley_item structure in particular contains much that is no
longer used.

=item * Make code clean under perlcritic.

=item * Better evaluation of sequences -- just push onto an array via
a ref, reversing at the end if necessary.  All that code could use
better comments.

=item * Should C<Parse::Marpa::Grammar::new> options be defaults or
overrides? -- that is they should take effect before the MDL script
or after.

=item * Allow setting Marpa options in evaluator,
and during life of recognizer?
Will require changes in internal tracking of phases.

=item * Add a trace_choices option.  There was an option to trace
non-trivial evaluation choices in the old evaluator, and the new trace_iterations
doesn't entirely replace it.

=item * Allow multiple evaluators for each recognizer, or at least create a method
to safely deep copy recognizers.

=item * If recognizer did not recognize the input, don't allow evaluator to be created.

=item * Add C<{}> and C<[]> syntax to MDL production statements.

=item * Ensure C<Parse::Marpa::Internal::This::grammar> set wherever appropriate.

=item * Add option for left-to-right evaluation by rules

=item * Test proper and perl5 separation

=item * Speed-up for pre-computing lexables.  Grammar::LEXABLES, etc.

=item * Add a SYNOPSIS to the Plumbing document.

=item * Test lexing suffixes.

=item * Allow alternation?

=item * Add to test set: Basic tests of all types of counted rules.
The matrix is separated yes vs. no;
and 0-1, 1-1, 0-2, 0-5, 1-2, 1-5, 0-*, 1-*, 2-*, versus 5-*.
Eliminate keep vs. no-keep, right vs. left.

=item * Downgrade version conflict or semantics mismatch to warning?
