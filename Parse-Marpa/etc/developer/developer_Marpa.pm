=head1 BEWARE: THIS RELEASE IS FOR DEVELOPERS ONLY

This is a developer's release, not for use by non-developers.
I use these releases because I want to see
results from the cpantesters,
and because I want to test the release process itself.

Of course, it's open source, and you're entitled to appoint yourself
a developer if you insist on it.  But that will usually not be a reasonable
thing to do.
