WARNING -- THIS IS A DEVELOPER'S RELEASE, NOT FOR USE BY NON-DEVELOPERS.
I use these releases to avail myself of the cpantesters results,
and to test the release process itself.

Of course, it's open source, and you're entitled to appoint yourself
a developer if you insist on it.  But that will usually not be a
reasonable thing to do.

Right now the documentation in this release is half-converted from
one interface to another, so it's incomplete and inconsistent.
