Tue May 21 14:21:16 2002: gc <guillaume.cottenceau at free.fr>

          <guillaume at morinfr.org>

          [Mon Apr  8 09:39:52 2002]

        * frozen-bubble: don't release the audio subsystem when disabling
          sound, there is a bug that prevents the music from coming back
          gracefully (I don't remember who reported this bug, sorry)
          [Tue Apr 16 15:20:41 2002]

          launcher graphics
          [Sat May 11 21:46:06 2002]

          (thx Olivier Andrieu <oandrieu at nerim.net>)
          [Sun May 12 18:38:34 2002]
        
        * frozen-bubble: 0.9.3


Fri Feb  8 13:13:58 2002: gc <guillaume.cottenceau at free.fr>

        * fb.pl: 0.9.2
        
        * README: fix line referral for footnote #6, fix a small english
          typo (thx to sbi)
         
        * Makefile:
           - substitute hard paths by PREFIX-provided path, at the end of
             the build
           - provide a default PREFIX of /usr/local
           - replace "make" occurences by "$(MAKE)" so that
             porting on OpenBSD is now possible
             
        * c_stuff/Makefile*: don't keep the perl generated makefile, it
          contains site specific stuff :-(, so use an helper Makefile to
          be sure to rebuild perl Makefile when necessary
             
        * fb.pl: Change wording for "new keys" dialog, p2/p1 was not very
          explicit, now "right-pl"/"left-pl"

        * fb.pl: Internalize my fixed version of
          SDL::Surface::display_format since sdlpl-1.12 is bugged
          (doesn't free memory) (and also sdlpl-1.08 was bugged like that
          -> the package will work with vanilla Mandrake 8.0)

        * c_stuff/lib/fbmdkcommon.pm: `backtrace' was missing :-(

        * SDL_mixer_patched: clean up site-specific files from configure

        * fb.pl: misc syntax fixes thx to pixel (a.k.a half pixelization)

        * SDL_mixer_patched/effect_position.c: endian patches from
          Guillaume Morin <guillaume at morinfr.org>

        * INSTALL: created

        * fb.pl;frozen-bubble: use LD_PRELOAD instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          to override perl-SDL LD_RUN_PATH messing with my patched
          SDL_mixer (thx Olivier Andrieu <oandrieu at nerim.net>)

        * fb.pl: at the beginning of initializing the game, make a short
          test to see if we have the data, to produce a more human
          readable error message if they are missing

        
Tue Feb  5 23:26:40 2002: gc <guillaume.cottenceau at free.fr>
         
        * fb.pl: 0.9.1 (Initial release)
