Testing TODO

=head1 PURPOSE

This file is to detail the tests, in a general sense, that have yet to be
written so that I don't forget them.

=head1 MISSING TESTS

=over 4

=item * Readonly filehandles

=over 4

=item * Mutations on readonly filehandles

This is to verify that the appropriate errors are thrown

=item * Run an optimize on a readonly FH

=back

=item * _copy_value()

For some reason, $c doesn't seem to be undefinable in _copy_value. Maybe this
means that the bless()ing should occur iff C<!$c-E<gt>isa('DBM::Deep')>?

=item * Splice

=over 4

=item * Undefined initial offset

=item * splicing in a group that's equal to the target

=back

=item * Passing in a fh without a file_offset

=item * Do I ever use print_at() without passing in offset?

=item * How should the inode check for locking happen?

=item * medium and large pack_sizes

Need to make sure I only run the large pack_size test on 64-bit Perls

=item * max_buckets check

=item * get_classname() on a deleted sector

How should this be triggered?!

=item * Open a corrupted file that has a header, but not initial reference

=item * Max out the number of transactions

=item * Delete something in the head that has its own value in a transaction

=item * Run an import within a transaction

=over 4

=item * Should all assignments with a non-scalar rvalue happen within a sub-transaction?

=item * Does this mean that sub-transactions should just be done right now?

It shouldn't be too hard to variablize which transaction is the base instead
of hard-coding 0 . . .

=back

=item * Delete something within a transaction, then commit.

Verify that the space is reusable by assigning more to the DB.
