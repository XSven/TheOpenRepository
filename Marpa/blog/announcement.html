<h1>Practical General BNF Parsing</h1>

<p>With a regular expression engine, there
are expectations.
You feed a regular expression to the RE engine, it parses with it.
That simple.

<p>A general BNF parser is one which fulfills the same
expectation for BNF.
Write your language in BNF, you got a parser.
But it hasn't been that simple.

<p>The guys who write the textbooks had pushed
general BNF parsing for years.
Improvements in these algorithms pushed
the speeds down to linear or close to it
for the kinds of language in practical use.

<p>But the general parsing algorithms had languished
on the textbook pages.
And it wasn't as easy as the academics suggested.
There were some obstacles that they didn't forsee.
But bottom line, they were right.
General BNF parsing is practical.

<p>To show this, I've written Marpa,
a general BNF parser
generator in pure-Perl.
Once Marpa looked good,
I used to write a practial parser
for a non-trivial task -- HTML parsing.
That HTML parser is Marpa::UrHTML,
and I've put it
to use in tasks I do routinely.

<p>Over the next weeks, I will do phased releases of Marpa.
The HTML parser is documented in the first release.
Over the next few weeks,
I will document Marpa,
the parse engine itself.
Further down the road, I'll write a Marpa C library,
and an XS wrapper.
