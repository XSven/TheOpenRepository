### portable
- delete c:\strawberry\perl\site\bin 

### ICE61: Upgrade.VersionMax cannot be equal to Upgrade.VersionMin unless both Min and Max are inclusive, otherwise no version will match. (OLDERVERSIONBEINGUPGRADED)
<?define CurrentVersion    = "5.16.0" ?> <!-- e.g. "5.14.2001" -->
<?define MinCanUpgradeVer  = "5.16.0" ?> <!-- e.g. "5.14.0" -->
<UpgradeVersion Property="OLDERVERSIONBEINGUPGRADED" Minimum="$(var.MinCanUpgradeVer)" IncludeMinimum='yes' Maximum="$(var.CurrentVersion)" IncludeMaximum='no' />  
5.14.2.1        5.14.2001
5.14.1.1        5.14.1001
5.14.1.0        5.14.1000
5.14.0.1        5.14.1
5.14.0.0        5.14.0

### missing URLs in _INFO_ files

### MSI upgrade code
- maybe use somethig else for beta releases

### add CreateReleaseNotes
- need ttvars
  build_date '22 Nov 2011'
  dist_list (HTML fragment or array) - maybe ugly hack based on env\AppDataRoaming\.cpanplus\authors\id\*
  dist_pkgs (HTML fragment or array) - see _get_dist_pkgs in old Perl-Dist-WiX\lib\Perl\Dist\WiX\Mixin\ReleaseNotes.pm
- MSM info file
- maybe save tool versions
  gcc, dmake, ... version into ->{data}->{output}
  perl -V output

### test MSI major upgrade feature
- it did not work in official 5.14.2.1 MSI (so not critical)

### CPANPLUS
- consider removing c:\strawberry\cpanplus - keep it in user profile/homedir

### ppm.xml
- old 5.12 repos
- perhaps different xml for 32/64bit versions
- maybe App::Strawberry::ppm  + switch to (using File::HomeDir->my_home . "/.ppm")

### ppm repos
    http://ppm4.activestate.com/MSWin32-x86/5.14/1400/package.xml (ppm4)
    http://trouchelle.com/ppm14/package.xml (ppm4)

--- LATER ---

### CPANPLUS_install_module.pl 
- how to pass multiple args via makefilepl_param, buildpl_param

### decide about (not)including: perl/vendor/lib/auto/DBD/mysql/libmysql_.dll
- not for now

### check for XXX FIXME TODO in the code
- ok for now

##### 64bit update_env.pl.bat
- set ENV without reboot - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3837014/how-do-i-set-an-win32-system-environment-variable-in-perl
- 32bit works fine (maybe a bug in Win32::API)

### modules (non critical)
- DB_File - disable in core (install later in vendor)
- FCGI - is installed in perl/lib (during UpgradeCpanModules) as it is required by CGI

### improve CreateRelocFiles
- search all in perl/bin (test for text/binary via -t)
- search *.url in image_dir
- search *.pm in image_dir

### perltoc.pod contains hardcoded paths to build directory
- not a new bug

### something better instead of workaround_get_dist_list()
- is kind of a hack (somehow works, not reliable)
--- TROUBLE MAKING MODULES ---

### failing tests:
Test::TCP (sometimes fails)
Prima (does not work with latest tiff-4.x)
