### MSI upgrade code
- maybe use somethig else for beta releases

### test MSI major upgrade feature
- it did not work in official 5.14.2.1 MSI (so not critical)

### CPANPLUS
- consider removing c:\strawberry\cpanplus - keep it in user profile/homedir

--- LATER ---

### missing URLs in _INFO_ files
- rebuild packs

### generate MSM info file

### CPANPLUS_install_module.pl 
- how to pass multiple args via makefilepl_param, buildpl_param

### decide about (not)including: perl/vendor/lib/auto/DBD/mysql/libmysql_.dll
- not for now

### check for XXX FIXME TODO in the code
- ok for now

##### 64bit update_env.pl.bat
- set ENV without reboot - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3837014/how-do-i-set-an-win32-system-environment-variable-in-perl
- 32bit works fine (maybe a bug in Win32::API)

### modules (non critical)
- DB_File - disable in core (install later in vendor)
- FCGI - is installed in perl/lib (during UpgradeCpanModules) as it is required by CGI

### improve CreateRelocFiles
- search all in perl/bin (test for text/binary via -t)
- search *.url in image_dir
- search *.pm in image_dir

### perltoc.pod contains hardcoded paths to build directory
- not a new bug

### something better instead of workaround_get_dist_list()
- is kind of a hack (somehow works, not reliable)

### PPM
- maybe App::Strawberry::PPM
