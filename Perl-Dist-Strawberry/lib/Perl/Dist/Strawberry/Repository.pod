=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::Strawberry::Repository - The repository that is used for Perl::Dist::Strawberry.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation describes the repository that Perl::Dist::Strawberry uses, 
and the branches that are currently being used as of October 2009.

=head1 REPOSITORY

Perl::Dist::Strawberry is currently on Adam Kennedy's "Open Repository" for 
CPAN authors, at L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/>

My understanding is that if you're a CPAN author, you can get commit access 
to it by asking Adam Kennedy for it. His e-mail address is 
C<< adamk@cpan.org >>.

If you aren't a CPAN author and need commit access for Perl::Dist::Strawberry, 
please e-mail me with what you'd like to do (a patch would be nice to see) and 
I'll recommend to him that you be given access.

In any case, before committing anything more than minor changes to the 
Perl-Dist-Strawberry trunk or branches, please e-mail me.  I'll probably say 
yes, but I need to know what you're planning to do, so that I don't accidentally 
step on your changes.

You may wish to work on your own branch, and then communicate with me to get it 
merged into the trunk, by doing:

	svn cp http://svn.ali.as/trunk/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/ http://svn.ali.as/branches/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/<branch_name>

=head1 BRANCHES

The trunk is currently unstable at the moment, due to the fact that the code 
underneath is in the process of changing from using 
L<Object::InsideOut|Object::InsideOut> and L<Object::Tiny|Object::Tiny> to 
L<Moose|Moose>.

Yes, I know Moose is "heavy" in the dependencies and initial loading time. 
The problems are that Object::Tiny is a little TOO tiny for what I need, 
and Object::InsideOut objects that contain other Object::InsideOut objects 
are very difficult to make L<Storable>, which breaks checkpointing.

Plus, with Moose, I gain the ability to check constructor parameters better,
the ability to extend logging, and the ability to factor out the XML generation
and handling to another distribution in a sane matter.

So here are the branches:

=head2 Trunk 

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/>

The trunk is currently working with Perl::Dist::WiX 1.000, although this will 
change soon.
