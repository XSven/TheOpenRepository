NAME
    Env::Constant - Exporting %ENV as constants

SYNOPSIS
      use Env::Constant qr/^PAR/;
  
      # This will fail at compile time if the $ENV{PAR_PROGNAME}
      # environment variable didn't exist:
      print ENV_PAR_PROGNAME, "\n";
  
      # regular constant sub, works fully qualified, too!
      package Foo;
      print main::ENV_PAR_PROGNAME, "\n"; 

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports a part or all of the environment variables in %ENV
    as constants with the "ENV_" prefix. You can select the

  EXPORT
    All contents of the %ENV hash by default as constants with a "ENV_"
    prefix. You can limit this to a part of %ENV by supplying a regular
    expression for matching against the keys.

CAVEATS
    You cannot export environment variables that contain characters that
    would be invalid in a Perl subroutine (aka constant) name. Such
    environment variables are warned about and then skipped.
