Changes for Perl extension File-IgnoreReadonly

0.02 Wed 10 Sep 2008
	- File::chmod can be used on Win32 (but in a way different to Unix)
	  so that we can avoid the extra dependency. Win32::File::Object was
	  overkill for the small task of making a file readonly or not.

0.01 Tue  5 Aug 2008
	- Creating initial release
