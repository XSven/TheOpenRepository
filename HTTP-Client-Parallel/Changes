Changes for Perl extension HTTP-Client-Parallel

0.03 Mon  7 Jul 2008 JBISBEE
        - Added three new constructor params to pass to 
          POE::Component::Client::Keepalive.   A PoCoCl::Keepalive session 
          was already being created behind the scences.  I just brought it
          out in the open so we can override things as nessesary.  
          (keep_alive and max_per_host defaults come from the defaults 
          the module itself uses.  The max_open defaults to 120.)
            - keep_alive - seconds to keep socket alive (defaults to 15)
            - max_per_host - max connections par host (defaults to 4)
            - max_open - max number of sockets to open (defaults to number of urls)
